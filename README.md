## Abstract

Magnetorheological (MR) fluids are smart fluids that undergo reversible phase transitions under a magnetic field. This study leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, including **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** and **Radial Basis Function (RBF)**, as well as **Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)** to predict shear stress behavior in MR fluids. The proposed models achieved high accuracy with minimal residual error, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to laboratory tests.

## Features

- **Models:** Implementation of MLP, RBF, and ANFIS for predictive modeling.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Predictions based on key parameters:  
  - Magnetite nanoparticle concentration  
  - Silicone oil viscosity  
  - Magnetic field strength  
  - Shear rate  
- **Optimized Accuracy:** Models validated against laboratory data, demonstrating exceptional R² and RMSE values.  
- **Practical Application:** Avoids extensive experimental work by providing pre-trained models and equations.
